## What
`steamCLI` is a command line tool that allows searching for game prices on
Steam straight from the command line. It supports recent and overall ratings,
current prices (on Steam), historical low price, different currencies and 
regions.

The tool was written purely in Python 3.6 and leverages 
[IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/) API. It can be installed via 
`pip`.

## Why
I wrote it mainly to mess with APIs and Python. Although I did have a genuine
use case at the time that I came up with this idea, as I did not particuarly
enjoy manually checking the prices.
