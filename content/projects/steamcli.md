`steamCLI` is a command line tool that allows searching for price information 
about games on Steam straight from the command line. It supports recent and 
overall ratings, current prices (on Steam), historical low price, different 
currencies and regions.

The tool was written purely in Python 3.6 and leverages 
[IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/) API (thanks!).
