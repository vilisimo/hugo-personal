title: Dropwizard Crud
draft: false
project: vault
---
The project is a proof of concept CRUD toy. It was mainly developed to gain familiarity with:

- Dropwizard
- Groovy
- Spock
- Camel
- Guice
- JDBI
- Docker

Hence, there is no complex logic. It mostly consists of wiring components and libraries to check
how they work with one another. In the future, however, it might serve as a useful reminder of 
how things work.
