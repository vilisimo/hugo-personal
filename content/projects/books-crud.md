The project is a proof of concept CRUD app. Its main purpose was to have a 
place to play with:

- Java 8
- Dropwizard
- Groovy + Spock
- Camel
- Guice
- JDBI
- Docker

It mostly consists of wiring components and libraries to check how they work 
with one another. Hence, it really is a simple CRUD app.
