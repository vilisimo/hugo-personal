The project is a proof of concept CRUD project. It was developed to gain familiarity with:

- Dropwizard
- Groovy + Spock
- Camel
- Guice
- JDBI
- Docker

There is no complex logic. It mostly consists of wiring components and libraries to check
how they work with one another. In the future, however, it might serve as a useful reminder
of how things work.
