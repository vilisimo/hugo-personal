`tasks` is a simple command line tool to enable creating and keeping track of tasks 
that need to be done.

The main reason for this project was to have a simple project that allows some 
degree of experimentation with the following technologies a little bit more:

- HSQLDB
- JDBC
- Liquibase
- Log4j2
- Maven
- Commons CLI

Apparently, coding CLI tools in Java is quite awkward. Who could have guessed.
