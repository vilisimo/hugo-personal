## What
Every serious programmer secretly craves to program todo applications. `tasks`
quenches this burning desire. It is a command line tool to enable creating and
keeping track of tasks that need to be done.

## Why
The main reason for this project was to have a simple project that allowed
some degree of experimentation with various Java-based technologies. In fact,
it was the first project that I used Java 9 with (mm, `Map.of`, come to mah 
belly).

Incidentally, coding CLI tools in Java turned out to be quite awkward. I was
shocked. Who could have thought.
