## What
"Emeperor" is a theme for Hugo-based websites. It is primarily aimed at blogs
and people who want to showcase their projects.

## Why
The main reason to create the theme was lack of themes that really caught my
eye. Although Emperor may not be the prettiest theme, it is a theme that I,
having created it, know inside out, and that is simple and easy to change.
Hence, I have a full control of how it looks.
