`cookme` serves as a simple recipe holder with a no-nonsense frontend.

A user can browse recipes that have been added by other users. Additionally, 
the user can search for ingredient(s) that he/she would like to use. If there 
are recipes containing them, the matching recipes will be shown. Furthermore, 
the user can add recipes and ingredients to his/her fridge. Once ingredients 
and recipes are added, the user can search the fridge for liked recipes that 
can be made with ingredients in the fridge.
