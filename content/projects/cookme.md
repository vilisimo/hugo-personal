https://cookmetoo.herokuapp.com/

A user is presented with a clean interface that enables browsing of recipes that have been added by
the website's users. Additionally, the user can search for ingredient(s) that he/she would like to 
use. If there are recipes containing them, the matching recipes will be shown. Furthermore, user can 
add recipes and ingredients to his/her fridge. Once ingredients and recipes are added, user can 
instruct the website to search the fridge for liked recipes that can be made with ingredients in the 
fridge.
