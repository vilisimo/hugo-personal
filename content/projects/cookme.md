## What
`cookme` serves as a simple recipe holder with a no-nonsense frontend. You
can visit it here: 

https://cookmetoo.herokuapp.com/

It takes a while to load the first time, as it is on a free Heroku tier.

A user can browse recipes that have been added by other users. Additionally,
the user can search for ingredient(s) that he/she would like to use. If there
are recipes containing them, the matching recipes will be shown. Furthermore,
the user can add recipes and ingredients to his/her fridge. Once ingredients
and recipes are added, the user can search the fridge for liked recipes that
can be made with ingredients in the fridge.

## Why
This was my first bigger project that spanned the whole stack (and then some).
In retrospect, it might have been easier just to focus on one thing at a time.
On the other hand, it was an excellent opportunity to write some terrible code
in four languages, so it all worked out quite well.
