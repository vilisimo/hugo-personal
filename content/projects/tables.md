## What
`tables` is a tool to build a table and print it to a terminal. It was
extracted from [tasks](https://github.com/vilisimo/tasks) project, when
printing a proper table proved to be more tricky than the actual project
itself.

## Why
There was no intention to write anything related to the tables when I started
dabbling with [tasks](https://github.com/vilisimo/tasks). However, once I
started thinking about how to approach printing multiline tables to a terminal
it quickly became clear that a few newlines here and there would not suffice.
