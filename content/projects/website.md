## What
The current blog, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is actually a combination of two projects, one being the blog itself, and
the other being the theme that the blog uses: 
[emperor](https://github.com/vilisimo/emperor).

## Why
I had been wondering about statically generated websites for a while until
one day I decided to have a go at it for an evening or two. A few months and
three themes (two heavily customised and one built from scratch) later I can
finally say I have a pretty firm grasp of how to cobble together a statically
generated website with Hugo.
