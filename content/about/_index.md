I'm Simonas. I work as a software developer. I have masters in Software 
Development and an undergraduate degree in Psychology (both awarded by 
University of Glasgow). 

At the moment, I am most involved with Java and Python. However, I might 
recognize HTML, CSS and JavaScript if I bumped into them in a broad daylight.
At work, I'm mostly doing backend stuff.
