I'm Simonas. 

I work as a software developer. I have masters in __Software Development__
and an undergraduate degree in __Psychology__ (both awarded by University 
of Glasgow). 

In my free time, I run, I read, I cook, and I code. I throw in a travel or 
two into the mix, too.

At the moment, I am most involved with __Java__ and __Python__. I dabble with 
__Dart__, and am eyeballing several other languages very intently in the hopes
of conjuring mastery from concentrated hopes and dreams. 

I might even recognize __HTML__, __CSS__ and __JavaScript__ if I bumped into 
them in a broad daylight. In fact, fishwives share the tales of an entire 
[website](https://cookmetoo.herokuapp.com) built on this knowledge. The particularly 
bold ones assert that it did not use any front-end frameworks (gasp) to prop 
it up.
