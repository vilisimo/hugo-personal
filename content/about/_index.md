I work as a software developer. I have masters in Software Development and an
undergraduate degree in Psychology (both awarded by University of Glasgow).

At work, I'm mostly doing backend stuff. At the moment, I am working with Java
and Groovy, writing microservices and making sure they don't fall down when
the wind starts blowing. To that end, I'm a heavy user of Spring Boot, Kafka,
Docker, Elasticsearch, Maven & Gradle, and various flavors of SQL. Majority of
my work is done on Linux, although on my free time I like to hack around on my
MacBook.

Nevertheless, my first and most beloved language is Python. I also dabble with
CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Currently, though, I am playing around with Dart
and Flutter by making an app to track my own expenses. You can follow my
progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/vilisimo/sink).
