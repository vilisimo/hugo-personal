I'm Simonas. 

I work as a software developer. I have masters in __Software Development__
and an undergraduate degree in __Psychology__ (both awarded by University 
of Glasgow). 

At the moment, I am most involved with __Java__ and __Python__. However, 
I might recognize __HTML__, __CSS__ and __JavaScript__ if I bumped into 
them in a broad daylight. In fact, fishwives share the tales of an 
entire [website](https://cookmetoo.herokuapp.com) built on this knowledge. 

In my free time, I run, I read, I cook, and I code. I throw in a travel or 
two into the mix, too.
