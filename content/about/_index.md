I'm Simonas.

I work as a software developer. I have masters in Software Development and an
undergraduate degree in Psychology (both awarded by University of Glasgow).

At work, I'm mostly doing backend stuff. At the moment, I am working with Java
and Groovy. However, my first and most beloved language is Python. Aside from
that, I also dabble with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

At work, I'm mostly working with Spring Boot, Maven & Gradle, Kafka, Docker, 
Elasticsearch and various flavors of SQL. Majority of my work is done on 
Linux, although on my free time I like to hack around on my MacBook.
