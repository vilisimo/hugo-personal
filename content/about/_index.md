I'm Simonas. I work as a software developer. I have masters in Software 
Development and an undergraduate degree in Psychology (both awarded by 
University of Glasgow). 

At work, I'm mostly doing backend stuff. At the moment, I am usually working
with Java and Groovy. However, off the clock my go to language is Python.
Nevertheless, I might also recognize HTML, CSS and JavaScript if I bumped into
them in a broad daylight.
